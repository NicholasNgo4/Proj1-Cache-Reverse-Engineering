# Project: HW1 Cache Reverse Engineering (ECE 592, Fall 2026)

See `README.md` for full project structure, build/run commands, and the
Phase I/II/III discipline (non-negotiable — read it before running anything
involving `perf`, PMU, or cache-topology files). This file is for a fresh
Claude Code session (e.g. after SSHing into a different lab machine) to
pick up current progress without re-deriving it. Note: a Claude session's
conversation history and memory do NOT transfer between machines (each
lab machine has its own local `/home`, confirmed not NFS-shared) — this
file, the repo's data/READMEs, and git history are the only things that do.

## Current status (update this section as work progresses)

**Capacity experiment: done on Sunbird and Artemisia, not yet started on the
other 6 machines.**

Sunbird's results (`data_raw/sunbird/capacity/`,
`data_processed/sunbird/capacity/`, including `plots/capacity_curve.png`
and `capacity_boxplots.png`) found three flat/ramp transitions across
1 KiB-256 MiB, confirmed via independent repeat runs (see
`data_raw/sunbird/README.md` for the full methodology notes, including a
documented multi-tenant-interference finding and a plotting-script bug
that was found and fixed along the way — read that file before trusting
any plateau/boundary number at face value).

Artemisia's original core-23 run (`data_raw/artemisia/capacity/`,
messier than Sunbird's) was **redone on 2026-09-09 on core 20** after
discovering core 23 shared its socket with other students' active processes.
The core-23 results are archived (not deleted) under
`data_processed/artemisia/capacity_prior_core23/` because the before/after
comparison itself turned out to be useful evidence, not just noise reduction:
repeating the sub-48 KiB P-state-bimodality anomaly and the 8-96 MiB
mid-transition noise on a verifiably idle core showed the sub-48 KiB anomaly
is **not** contention-related (persisted essentially unchanged — confirms the
P-state/turbo hypothesis), while the 8-96 MiB noise **partially** improved
(median rep-to-rep spread roughly halved, 7.9%->4.2%) but its worst-case
spread did not (~93-96% either way), meaning contention explains only part of
that region's noise. The 256 MiB-1 GiB random-pattern growth also dropped
from +21.8% (core 23) to +10.8% (core 20) — still climbing, still no
flattening by 1 GiB, but contention was inflating the apparent growth rate.
Sequential pattern's ~90 MiB+ plateau (~35.3-35.9 ticks/access) matched to
within 0.4% between the two runs, confirming it's genuine hardware behavior.
**Read `data_raw/artemisia/README.md` in full before trusting any number from
this machine** — the "Detected boundaries and plateau status" table and the
two Anomaly writeups (each now with a core-20-vs-core-23 comparison) are
load-bearing, not optional color. Current primary plots are
`data_processed/artemisia/capacity/plots/` (core 20); archived core-23 plots
are alongside the archived summaries. Both the original and the redo's
long-running sweeps were run inside detached `tmux` sessions specifically so
they'd survive the driving Claude Code session disconnecting (see
`data_raw/artemisia/capacity/run_full_redo_core20.sh` and
`run_extension_repeats.sh`) — for the redo, a *second* tmux session was also
used just to poll for completion, since even a background-task watcher tied
to the Claude Code session itself doesn't survive that session dying, only
tmux on the machine does. That pattern (tmux for anything that'll run longer
than one sitting, plus a tmux-based watcher if you want progress-tracking to
survive too) is worth reusing on the remaining machines, since a single
256 MiB-1 GiB random-pattern dense sweep alone takes ~60 minutes of wall time.
Also worth reusing: don't trust a single `ps`/`proc/stat` snapshot when
picking an idle core on this machine — per-core load moved around visibly
across three consecutive 6s sampling windows taken seconds apart during the
redo's core selection.

**`scripts/run_capacity_full.sh <machine> <core> [coarse_max_bytes]` is
the one-command pipeline for running the capacity experiment on each
remaining machine** (Thunderbird, Skylark, Charnwood, Crux, Ookay,
Upgrade): coarse sweep -> automatic boundary detection -> dense
sweep per boundary -> reproducibility repeats on the deepest boundary ->
tail-extension sweep to check for a further plateau -> plots. It is
deliberately non-adaptive (see the script's own header comment for why).
After it finishes on a machine, fill in that machine's
`data_raw/<machine>/README.md` using the core/seed/timestamp/boundaries
it prints at the end — and, per the Artemisia experience, actually check
whether the topmost region has flattened within the swept range before
treating the default output as final; if it hasn't, run a manual follow-up
tail sweep (+ a couple of repeats) the way both Sunbird and Artemisia
needed, ideally inside `tmux` since these follow-ups run long.

**Before running it on Thunderbird (the one ARM/AArch64 machine):**
`main_code/aarch64/timer_arm.h` has never been validated on real hardware.
Do a small standalone sanity check first (a handful of timed loads,
confirm `CNTVCT_EL0` is readable unprivileged and has usable resolution)
before trusting a full sweep's numbers there.

**Not yet started:** line size, associativity, hit/miss latency,
inclusion/exclusion experiments (only `--experiment capacity` exists in
`cache_bench` so far — see `main_code/common/main.c` usage text). PMU
verification (Phase II) and Hazel (Phase III) have not started; Phase I
must be frozen/tagged first per `README.md`.

## Known constraints from prior sessions

- Compile baseline is `-O0 -g -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer`
  (see `Makefile`) — do not add optimization or drop `-g`/frame-pointer
  without updating the disassembly-inspection evidence too.
- Every `cache_bench` run must be pinned with `taskset -c <core>` (or
  `srun --cpu-bind=cores` on Hazel) — check `Cpus_allowed_list` and
  `lscpu -e=CPU,CORE,SOCKET,NODE` first to pick a full physical core (both
  SMT siblings) actually available to your session, and check `who`/`ps`
  for other students' active processes on this shared machine before
  assuming a core is quiet. On Artemisia this wasn't enough on its own —
  the actual per-core load only showed up via `/proc/stat` idle-time deltas
  over a few seconds; `ps`'s point-in-time snapshot both missed a busy core
  and flagged an idle one as busy due to a since-finished process. Sample
  `/proc/stat`, don't just trust one `ps` snapshot.
- `scripts/plot_capacity.py` combines overlapping (pattern, size) rows
  across input summary CSVs by averaging rather than letting the last
  file win — this matters because dense/repeat sweeps sharing a log-spaced
  grid will legitimately collide on many exact sizes. On a shared machine
  this averaging can be misleading if the overlapping runs span a large
  time gap (see Artemisia's Anomaly 2) — check whether high spread at a
  point is per-run-noise or a session-level split before trusting the
  combined median.
- Long dense sweeps (anything covering ~100+ MiB working sets at the
  `random` pattern) cost real wall time — roughly an hour per full sweep at
  the default sample count, since random-pattern latency is dominated by
  genuine uncached DRAM access with no prefetch help (~8x slower than the
  `sequential` pattern at the same size). Run anything in this range inside
  `tmux` (`tmux new-session -d -s <name> '<script> 2>&1 | tee -a <log>'`)
  so it survives the driving session disconnecting, and poll the log file
  for a completion sentinel rather than relying on harness-managed
  background-task tracking alone.
